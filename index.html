            <h2>protein</h2>
            <p>Proteins are made up of chemical 'building blocks'  called amino acids. Your body uses amino acids to build and repair muscles and bones and to make hormones and enzymes. They can also be used as an energy source. You can easily meet your daily protein needs by following the Australian Dietary Guidelines.Protein, highly complex substance that is present in all living organisms. Proteins are of great nutritional value and are directly involved in the chemical processes essential for life. The importance of proteins was recognized by chemists in the early 19th century including Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius, who in 1838 coined the term protein, a word derived from the Greek prōteios, meaning “holding first place.”</p>

            <p>
                The difference is that those that stay solid at room temperatures are called fats while those that stay liquid at room temperatures are called oils. Chemically, each fat or oil molecule consists of three long strings of fatty acid molecules combined with a glycerol molecule.What Are Fats and Oils? Some people think that fats and oils are different things. But in reality, they share a common chemical structure and similar properties. The difference is that those that stay solid at room temperatures are called fats while those that stay liquid at room temperatures are called oils.</p>
